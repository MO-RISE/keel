# Infrastructure guidelines

A good first overview of the possible infrastructure setups using Zenoh can be found [here](https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/deployment/).

In addition, keelson makes use of mTLS when connecting router-to-router, see [here](https://zenoh.io/docs/manual/tls/) for details.

At this point, Zenoh does not support proper Access Control to different subsets of key expressions (topics).
