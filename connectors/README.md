# Connectors

This folder contain the small or early stage connectors to keelson. Commonly, a connector is either a communication bridge towards

* a sensor hardware
* another middleware
* a centralized data provider
* an HMI
* a logging system
* etc

For example, a connector to a sensor hardware is, typically, a publisher of data and, possibly, a responder to requests for changing the sensor settings.

For details of each of the connectors provided in this repo, see the specific README.md in that subfolder.
